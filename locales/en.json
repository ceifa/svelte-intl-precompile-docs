  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-1": "Svelte-intl-precompile is an i18n library for svelte apps that aims to provide all the features your app may need with the smallest possible penalty in both app size and runtime performance.",
  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-2": "To accomplish that, it takes a different approach to most	internationalization libraries. Much like Svelte.js analyzes and understands your code and at build time compiles it to minimal and efficient javascript, this library inspects your translations defined in the  <a href='https://lokalise.com/blog/complete-guide-to-icu-message-format' class='text-primary underline'>ICU message syntax</a> and compiles them to small and efficient inline functions.",
  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-3": "If you use each and every feature supported by the ICU message syntax it will add around 2kb to your bundled after minification and compression. If you only use a few, it can go as low as 1kb.",
  "introduction.paragraph.why-use-it-4": "Since it doesn't have to parse and tokenize your app in the browser, it is also faster. Around 4 times faster rendering a translation for the first time, and around 50% faster for already known translations.",
